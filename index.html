								Hello there! I am an astrophysicist embarking on the next chapter of my career. 
								During my time in academia, I had the opportunity to work on a range of fascinating 
								projects and develop a diverse set of skills, and I am excited to explore new opportunities 
								and put my skills to use. I hope that my website provides you with a valuable insight 
								into my experience and perspective.

						     <b><a href="https://github.com/linaflorez/DESI-ML-Project" target="_blank">DESI Spectra Analysis</a></b><br>
						        Explore the complexities of DESI spectra, where coefficients derived from various reduction methods, combined with two machine learning regression models, predict physical characteristics of DESI galaxies. Vital for future DESI spectral analysis, this project provides a robust methodology for swift and accurate estimation of galactic properties.

						    <h3>Key Questions:</h3>
						    <ul>
						        <li>What is the optimal number of PCA coefficients for accurate predictions?</li>
						        <li>Comparing PCA and UMAP coefficients, which is more effective in predicting parameters?</li>
						        <li>Which combination of coefficients and machine learning models yields the most precise predictions?</li>
